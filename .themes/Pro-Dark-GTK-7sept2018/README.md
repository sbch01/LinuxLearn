A clear and easy-on-the-eyes theme that is meant for those who use the Gnome-desktop professionally on a daily basis. The focus in this theme is compatibility: GTK-2 applications and GTK-3 applications look virtually the same. Libre-office, Scribus, Evolution, Geary, Planner, GnuCash, LaTeXila, Geany, the Gimp, Inkscape,...

Chrome, firefox, Web and Opera have no issues with this theme.

About the looks, you will notice some Elementary-theme, Arc-theme and Gnome-OSX, in a darker version.

Gnome 3.28 ready, with crispier fonts, new hover-effects and new check- and radio-items, and the use of gradient-colors (even on GTK2-menu's), and reduced clutter on the headerbar (simple headerbar buttons) makes this new version a more serene, comfortable layout for your daily jobs. I've also added rounded and transparent menu's and context-menu's on GTK3-compliant app's.

## Requirements

When, as such, theming does not look the way it should be: make sure you have installed the necessary theme-"engines"

GTK2 ENGINES REQUIREMENT

- GTK2 engine Murrine
- GTK2 engine Pixbuf

Fedora/RedHat distros:
yum install gtk-murrine-engine gtk2-engines

Ubuntu/Mint/Debian distros:
sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-murrine gtk2-engines-pixbuf

ArchLinux:
pacman -S gtk-engine-murrine gtk-engines

## How to install:

Extract and put it into the themes directory i.e. ~/.themes/ or /usr/share/themes/ (create it if necessary).Then change the theme via distribution specific tool like Gnome tweak tool or Unity tweak tool, etc. (If you use Snap-packages instead of app's from the normal repositories than definitely put the theme to /usr/share/themes/.
